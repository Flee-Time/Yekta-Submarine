# Submarine
This is the Official repository of the YEKTA Team Submarine firmware for an arduino Nano. We have created a submarine firmware that can utilize PID correction, realtime communication and telemety via an Arduino Nano with an MPU6050 Gyro and Accelerometer sensor. This firmware was designed to be used with an complimentary Raspberry Pi as a calculation unit for image proccesing and complete wireless activity. Our goal is to make a small, efficient, lightweight and a modular submarine for use in AI operations.
